# Planetary Entry Study

This repository is dedicated to the study and analysis of planetary entry, specifically for the Earth's atmosphere. The projects included in this repository explore and compare two prominent methodologies for solving the problem: the Allen-Eggers solution and the Analytical solution.

## Projects

### 1. Allen-Eggers Solution

The Allen-Eggers solution offers a simplified approach to the problem of atmospheric entry. Named after H. Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers Jr., this method provides an approximate solution to the entry dynamics of a vehicle entering an atmosphere.

#### Theory

The Allen-Eggers solution assumes a ballistic trajectory with no lift, constant drag coefficient, and an exponential atmosphere. The solution predicts the deceleration, velocity, and altitude profiles of the vehicle during entry, and is particularly useful in the preliminary stages of design to estimate entry loads and design the heat shield.

### 2. Analytical Solution

An analytical solution offers a more accurate but complex approach to the problem of atmospheric entry. This solution considers factors such as the variation in atmospheric density with altitude, vehicle lift, and changing drag coefficient.

#### Theory

The analytical solution to the planetary entry problem uses the equations of motion to model the dynamics of a vehicle during entry. It often involves solving these equations numerically due to the non-linearity of the problem.

The analytical solution can provide more precise predictions than the Allen-Eggers solution, but it requires a more detailed knowledge of the entry vehicle and atmospheric properties. This approach can be used for final design and accurate trajectory predictions.
